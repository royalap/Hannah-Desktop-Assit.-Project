#Hannah Desktop Assistant Project
Hannah is a Python-based desktop assistant designed to help users with various tasks using voice commands. The assistant leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries, allowing for a hands-free experience on the desktop.

#Features
Voice Recognition: Uses Google Speech Recognition to interpret user commands.
Text-to-Speech: Converts responses to audio using Python's text-to-speech capabilities.
Task Automation: Automates tasks like opening applications, performing searches, and managing simple desktop tasks.
Extensible: The project is modular, so new commands and features can be added with ease.
#Prerequisites
To run Hannah, you need the following Python libraries installed:

SpeechRecognition (for voice input recognition)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech synthesis)
pyaudio (for handling microphone input)
You can install these using pip:
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio

#Installation

#Clone the Repository:
'git clone https://github.com/royalap/Hannah-Desktop-Assit.-Project.git'
cd Hannah-Desktop-Assit-Project

#Run the Assistant: Run the main Python script to start the assistant:
python HANNAH_VIRTUAL_ASSISTANT_PROJECT.py
Usage
After running the assistant, Hannah will listen for commands and respond accordingly. Commands can include:

#General inquiries: "What time is it?", "What's the weather like?"
Application commands: "Open Chrome", "Launch Notepad"
Search commands: "Search for Python tutorials"
#Example Commands
"Open YouTube"
"What is the date today?"
"Tell me a joke"

#Error Handling
#In case of recognition errors, make sure:

You have an active internet connection.
Your microphone is working and accessible by Python.
Troubleshooting
